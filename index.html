        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Mikayla Gomez, and I am currently attending the University of California, Riverside, working towards a Bachelor’s degree in Film and Media Production and a concentration in Film Making. Over the course of my time here, I will be studying under greate creatives in the Film Industry and working to improve and hone my technical skills in editing and sound design.<br><br>

        Currently, I have edited and worked sound on my own short films over the course of my high school years, as well as a few other director’s productions, involving short films and Youtube vlogs. I have a few short film examples uploaded to my Youtube channel, which will be linked down below for you to view and get a better understanding of my portfolio.


I am currently using Adobe for my Editing and Logic X Pro for my Sound Design. Should you have any concerns with either program, I am happy to explain my reasoning for choosing either platform or even switch platforms for whichever is best compatible with your project and the other techs working on it.  

I should mention that my experience with foley, both capturing and creating, is rather limited. Should I be considered for the team, I would highly recommend a foley creator so that the foley will be better captured, and the project may be produced to the best of my ability. Furthermore, this interaction may also aid in furthering my experience with foley and improve my skills should you consider me for more future projects. 

I have worked on multiple projects with a more natural ambience. Typically quiet settings, requiring ambient additions such as dog barks, birds, cars, or wind. I have also worked with score creators to implement non-diegetic music into a project without taking away from dialogue, or being too quiet to the point of making the score useless. I have yet to work on more intense projects, such as a horror or thriller. However, I am never one to back away from a challenge and will work and rework scenes until the director is satisfied with the sound or editing as a whole. 

I do also happen to be a screenwriter. Though my scripts do happen to be few and far between, they have been performed on stage and serve as the basis for many of my aforementioned self produced projects. These productions have received much positive feedback from audiences and further demonstrate my more creative aspects, as compared to my more technical work that I am looking for. Should you be interested in producing or viewing one of these scripts, however, I will have a few samples linked as well for your reading pleasure and welcome any inclinations into my works or requests for productions.

        Should you have any further questions, my socials and contact information will be linked throughout the rest of the page. Feel free to reach out and contact me if you are interested in any of my editing, sound design, or writing projects.
